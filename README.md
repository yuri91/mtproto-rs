# MTProto-rs

Telegram API framework written in Rust.

This is so unfinished... but eventually it will be a full-fledged library for
interacting with Telegram as a regular user Account (This does not use the Bot
API, but the Telegram API). 

## TODO List

- [x] Implement Serialization/Deserialization of basic TL types
- [x] Implement automatic code generation for Ser/De of Types defined in the current schema
- [ ] Implement automatic code generation for the function defined in the current schema
- [ ] Implement the actual MTProto in ordet to communicate with Telegram
- [ ] Provide high level methods for interacting with the Server
